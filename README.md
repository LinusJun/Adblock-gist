## Work with *[anti-AD](https://github.com/privacy-protection-tools/anti-AD)*:

After Version 4.2.2, Surge is able to load 1,000,000+ rules through ```DOMAIN-SET```. **anti-AD** is an abundant adblocking filter list based on *Easylist* and optimised for Chinese websites. If you like to use anti-AD rules through *DOMAIN-SET*, please subscribe the supplement version (deduplicated already).

DOMAIN-SET example:
```
DOMAIN-SET,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/privacy-protection-tools/anti-AD/master/anti-ad-domains.txt,REJECT
```

## Work with *Mock (Map Local)*

This feature allows Surge to return an empty json to the network request, which can significantly reduce RAM usage on device than JavaScript(Yachen Liu, Testflight 1723). Mocking feature is now universial and available on *Surge Module* and base configuration. **The fuction of mocking in this gist is duplicate with ```URL-REGEX rules```, choose one you prefer.**

## Create your own Surge Module:
```
#!name=$yourname
#!desc=$yourdescription
// Optional - ignore if you need both
#!system=(ios/mac)

[Rule]
RULE-SET,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TPCTPCTPC/Adblock-gist/master/DOMAINs/EXAMPLE.list,REJECT
RULE-SET,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TPCTPCTPC/Adblock-gist/master/URL-REGEX/EXAMPLE.list,REJECT

[Map Local]
^https://mp\.weixin\.qq\.com/mp/getappmsgad data="empty.json" //You can generate an empty json on your own surge.

// Optional
[MITM]
hostname = %APPEND% an.example.com
```

### Why create your own *Module*?

It is your responsibility to avoid risks from the Man-In-The-Middle attack. 
A remote *Module* can be easily incerted any new hostnames and Javascripts, which could significantly increase the risk of your networking safety, if the user did not notice the change when updating the *Module*.

## Quantumult X Users?
ADBLOCK-GIST now supports QX with [domain rules](https://github.com/TPCTPCTPC/Adblock-gist/tree/master/DOMAINs) compatibly and [url-rewrites rules](https://github.com/TPCTPCTPC/Adblock-gist/tree/master/URL-REWRITE) exclusively.
